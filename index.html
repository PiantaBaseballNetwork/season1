Welcome to the Pianta Baseball Network! Home to all sorts of baseball related stats!
<br/><br/>
The fuel for this site is nothing more than the post match JSON files you can find in documents/projectrio/statfiles
<br/>
So make sure the submit them after every official game!
<br/><br/>
Note: This site is probably a bit jank. Feel free to let me know if something seems off so I can fix it.
<br/>
I'll be posting this once its functional but I plan to make it look nicer and maybe increase what it can do over time.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>
Things I want to add:
<br/>* Character images
<br/>* A way to see current team compositions
<br/>* Better overall UI and some more interactive elements
<br/>* Advanced stats
<br/>* Probably more but if you can think of anything obvious or cool let me know and maybe itll happen!
