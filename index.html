Welcome to the Pianta Baseball Network! Home to all sorts of baseball related stats!
<br/><br/>
The fuel for this site is nothing more than the post match JSON files you can find in documents/projectrio/statfiles
<br/>
So make sure the submit them after every official game!
<br/><br/>
NEW: OBP, SLG, and OPS are now on the stat sheets. 420.69 has also been replaced by "N/A" for the ERA stat.
<br/><br/>
Note: Currently working on some improvements so the site might not work 100% today (test3)
<br/><br/>
<b>
Things I want to add:
<br/>* Character images
<br/>* A way to see current team compositions
<br/>* Better overall UI and some more interactive elements
<br/>* Advanced stats
<br/>* Better color scheme
<br/>* highlight rows on click for easier viewing
<br/>* reformat match dates to be more readable
<br/>* Probably more but if you can think of anything obvious or cool let me know and maybe itll happen!
